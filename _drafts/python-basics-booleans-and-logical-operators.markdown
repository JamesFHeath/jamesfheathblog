### Boolean Introduction
In Python, booleans are a type with two values, *True* or *False*. 
They can be operated on and queried with functions like *if*, *and*, *or*. 
Python also has a sense of *truthy* and *falsey* values, values that will act as true or false when given to if statements. 

### Working with Booleans
Python uses *if*, *elif*, and *else* to execute code based on boolean values. 
*if* and *elif* preceede an expression that evaluates to a boolean value, and execute the code indented below them if the value is True. 
*else* blocks of code will execute if all *if*s and *elif*s failed.

Python uses the words *and*/*or* for logical and/or, as opposed to symbols like &.
