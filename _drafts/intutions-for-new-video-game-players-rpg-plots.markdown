### RPG Plots
RPGs are great fun, and the rich stories and memorable character are just as important as the actual gameplay. 
The two main categories of RPG are Western and Japanese (JRPGs). 
This post is going to go through some themes, tropes, cliches and what to expect when you jump into one of these worlds. 

### Western RPGs
#### Fantasy
Western RPGs in the fantasy genre are heavily influence by Dungeons and Dragons. 
Knowing to look out for orcs and trolls in caves, elves in the forest, humans in cities and towns and dwarves in mountains will get you started. 
By the end of the game, there should be at least one dragon. 
Western RPGs tend to give you a lot of freedom to choose your character's action, probably a result of the D&D heritage.
