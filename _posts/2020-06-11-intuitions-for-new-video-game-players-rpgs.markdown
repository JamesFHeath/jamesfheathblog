### RPGs
[Role-Playing Games (RPGs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game) are an expansive video game genre. 
They include similary elements, but the definition is not precise.
If your game includes a focus on story, character's developing their abilities through the game, a 3rd person view, and many playable characters then you can probably consider it an RPG. 

### Powering Up!
A core element of RPGs is increasing your character(s)' power over the course of the game. 
This is commonly done through combat encounter, though it may also include non combat abilities like tradeskills or social skills. 
[Dungeons and Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons) esque table top games are often the ancestors of today's video game RPGs.  
More often than not, trying to get bigger and bigger numbers on your "stats" (strength, intellect, charisma, etc) is the way to go.

### Items
Throughout your RPG journey, your character will probably obtain many items. 
These may be weapons, armor, potions or bandages, keys, maps, and treasure. 
Finding wealth and power through items in a game often involves taking the road less travelled. 
If the game is directing you in a certain geographic direction, it's often worth ignoring the plot and wandering off to look for treasure. 
Especially if you are struggling to defeat stronger enemies, taking a detour to obtain items is often an optimal strategy. 

### Example Games
1. Final Fantasy series

[Final Fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy) is a series of Japanese RPG games (JRPGs) dating back to 1987. 
Along with other series like [Dragon Quest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Quest), defined the JRPG genre. 
Starting with Final Fantasy 7, 9 or 10 will let you know if you enjoy these games. 

2. Mass Effect trilogy

The [Mass Effect trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect#Mass_Effect_Trilogy) is a science fiction 3rd person shooter series. 
You play the role of a "Specter", basically a secret agent of the galactic government and uncover a conspiracy to wipe out all life in the galaxy. 
Great action, writing and characters. 

3. Diablo franchise

[Diablo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_(series)) is a wonderful franchise if you're into gothic themes and slaying demons. 
It's a "hack and slash" game where you up the mantle of a warrior fighting the evil forces of the demon Diablo. 
Whether you're using magic or swords or summoning beasts to fight with you, it's great to get in a take down some monsters. 
Starting with Diablo 3 on a console like PS4 or Switch is a good way to get started, as it's the most intuitive and approachable title in the franchise. 

There are a million more great RPGs out there, this is just a starting point. 
Jump in and see what you like!
