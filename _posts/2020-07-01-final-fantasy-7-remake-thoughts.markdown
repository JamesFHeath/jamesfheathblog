### Before the Release

I pre ordered the FF7 remake, the first game I've pre ordered in a long time.
FF7 was my first JRPG, and it holds a special place in my heart. 
Over time, I've learned to love the genre. 
Even so, I was really skeptical about the remake because I was so disappointed with FFXV.
The real-time combat was boring, the characters were generic, and the plot was a mess. 
Then I played the FF7 demo and realized it was everything I had ever wanted!

### Playing the Demo

The demo starts with the same opening as the original, with the attack on the Mako Reactor. 
(I always pronounced it make-o, but apparently it's mach-o)
Immediately the game pulled me in, the music hit all the same beats but it was completely reorchestrated.
The combat felt visceral and weighty, much closer to God of War than FFXV. 
I was hooked.

### Getting Hooked

Once I finally received my copy, I played and played for weeks. 
I went through trying to get every possible secret, do every side quest. 
It was a fantastic experience from start to finish, a love letter to the original. 
It really felt like what FF7 would have been if it were made today.
