### Introduction
On a whim, I've decided to start reading some of the "classics". 
Socrates did not particularly hook me, but the Federalist Papers drew me in immediately. 
The Federalist Papers were written by "Publius" (Alexander Hamilton et al) in order to argue for the ratification of the US Constitution after the failings of the Articles of Confederation.
I knew this basic story, but reading the text shows the thought process of the founders of the US. 
The writings are as relevant today as they ever were, and they provide strong arguments that the Constitution is the best form of government available to our country. 

### Federalist 1
Federalist 1 is an introduction, and it's clear that the author (Hamilton) believes everyone, even the anti-Federalists, realize that the Articles of Confederation are insufficient. 
The question posed in the introduction is whether a society founded with a strong Constitution can forge its own path, or "whether they are forever destined to depend for their political constitutions on accident and force".

Hamilton lays out the thrust of his argument, that the form of government most likely to succeed is one based on the current state constitutions. 
He believes that the new federal government will need more power, but that the power will help preserve the union while still upholding republican principles. 
It's clear that Hamilton is speaking directly against some of his opponents, who are skeptical of a stronger central government. 
The later Federalist Papers make specific his arguments, and I believe they are incredibly persuasive and still help to justify our government in 2020.
